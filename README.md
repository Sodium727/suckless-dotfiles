prequisities:
- look in the `.xinitrc` file
- some build tools like `make` and `gcc` i guess

usage:
- for me, i would rename and put the items as follow:
`.xinitrc` -> `~/.xinitrc`
`dwm/` -> `~/.dwm/`
`dmenu/` -> `~/.dmenu/` 
`st/` -> `~/.st/`

but it's all up to you

notes:
- the status bar is a bash script `bar.sh` that is meant to locate in `~/.dwm/scripts/bar.sh`. if you wish to change that, modify the `.xinitrc` file first
